### Problems: mink function not found or undefined

With old versions of Matlab (R2017a and before), you may not able to run this code since there is no "mink" function. Besides updating your Matlab version, you may also refer to the Min-Max Selection package where a third-part "mink" function is included, but it may crash when compiled using a newer compiler. Here is the package: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23576-min-max-selection.
